  <br>

  <p>Subject: Application for full time position of Software Engineer</p>
  <br>

  <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
<br>
  <p>
    I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer position at Technova Solutions. Myself,
    Kazi Rabit Jahir, recently graduated from the University of Information Technology and Sciences (UITS), 
    Bangladesh,
    with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, earning a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00. 
    My academic achievements, combined with hands-on project experience and deep enthusiasm for Artificial 
    Intelligence and software innovation, make me eager to contribute to your team.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    Throughout my studies, I led and collaborated on numerous software development projects, where I gained 
    practical expertise in Java, Python, and C++, as well as proficiency in developing efficient, scalable,
     and user-focused applications. I also explored the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
     and Cybersecurity, driven by a passion to merge these domains in meaningful ways. My focus lies in 
     advancing AI-integrated systems that enhance automation, improve reliability, and reduce risks of 
     misinformation and misuse in modern AI tools.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    Beyond academics, I have always been committed to sharing knowledge. Although I have not served 
    formally as a teaching assistant, I have consistently helped my classmates and juniors understand 
    programming concepts and project development, an experience that strengthened my leadership, 
    communication, and mentoring abilities.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    I am especially drawn to Technova Solutions because of its forward-thinking approach to software 
    engineering and innovation. The company's focus on technology-driven, problem-solving aligns with my goal 
    of developing intelligent, secure, and impactful software solutions. My practice as an AI Innovator, 
    AI Polymath, and AI Generalist has prepared me to adapt quickly, explore creative ideas, and work 
    effectively in dynamic environments. I also have a strong knowledge of AI integration, to enhance
    software functionality and user experience.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    Outside of my technical work, I actively engage in basketball, table tennis, and chess, which have
    taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, and strategic thinking-qualities I bring to every 
    professional challenge.

  </p>
<br>
  <p>
    I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to Technova Solutions and 
    to grow within an environment that values innovation and collaboration. 
   <br> Thank you very much for 
    considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and 
    ambitions align with your team's goals.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
